Workmate is a desktop agent workspace where digital employees can chat, run orchestrated projects, use Skills, search knowledge bases / MCP connectors / the web, manage assets, and coordinate through external channels such as Telegram, Feishu, and a remote relay. Heavy orchestration lives in a server-side state machine, so the desktop UI, gateway processes, and future remote terminals can share one consistent view of sessions, approvals, runs, assets, and project state.

The repository deliberately keeps the Electron shell thin:

```text
Electron shell  ->  local Fastify API  ->  agent-core (pi / AgentScope / dsh)  ->  providers
Vue renderer  ------ HTTP / SSE -------^
gateway child ------ HTTP / SSE -------^   (Telegram / Feishu / remote relay)
```

## Highlights

| Capability | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Digital employees | Responsibility and authorization units with configurable model, Skills, runtime preferences, and permission tiers |
| Execution backends | Unified `ExecutionBackend` registry with built-in `pi`, optional `AgentScope` sidecar pool, and `dsh` coding sidecar |
| Skills (progressive disclosure) | Authorize metadata first, load `SKILL.md` on demand, then access resources/scripts inside an isolated run workspace |
| Project orchestration | Goal -> **Plan vN** (DAG) -> confirm -> **Run**; follow-up instructions create **ChangeSet** invalidations instead of rewriting everything |
| Resumable approvals | Tool approvals park a run in `waiting-approval`; resolving an approval resumes the same turn automatically as a new attempt |
| Session rolling memory | Per-session `memory.summary` plus watermark; long conversations compress automatically while the transcript remains the source of truth |
| Dual workspaces | Per-run workspaces for process files; final deliverables are promoted into a shared project workspace via `publish_to_project` |
| Knowledge / MCP / web search | Local LanceDB, cloud knowledge connectors, MCP (`http` / `sse` / `stdio`), and multiple web-search providers |
| Channels and remote office | Gateway child process with Telegram, Feishu, personal allowlists, and a remote relay device link |
| Local embedding sidecar | Experimental desktop-managed local embedding runtime/proxy with provider registration scaffolding and dedicated design docs |
| Local-first storage | Domain data has a single durable writer (the API process); secrets stay encrypted in the desktop main process and are released only over fork IPC |

## Repository layout

| Path | Role |
| --- | --- |
| `apps/desktop` | Thin Electron main process: windowing, IPC, sql.js secret/asset store, forks API and gateway |
| `apps/renderer` | Vue 3 UI (Vite + Tailwind), browser-only, talks over HTTP/SSE and desktop IPC |
| `apps/api` | Localhost Fastify service hosting orchestration routes and the domain KV writer |
| `apps/gateway` | Gateway child process for Telegram / Feishu / remote relay |
| `packages/contracts` | Shared Zod contracts, the source of truth for runtime payloads and events |
| `packages/agent-core` | Model execution layer and runtime adapters; the only layer that talks to model SDKs |
| `packages/orchestrator` | Server-side session / run / approval / project state machines |
| `packages/channel` | Transport-agnostic channel protocol and message abstractions |
| `packages/tools` | Tool contracts and risk metadata |
| `packages/storage`, `packages/ui-kit` | Reserved placeholders |

See [docs/design/architecture.md](docs/design/architecture.md) for the current canonical architecture.

## Quick start

Requirements: Node.js `>= 22`, pnpm `>= 10`.  
Python `>= 3.10` is needed only when using AgentScope sidecars.

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm dev
pnpm typecheck
pnpm build
pnpm package
```

For the local web launcher / npm runtime:

```bash
pnpm web:build
pnpm web:start
```

For the packaged CLI / npm payload:

```bash
npm install -g @next-open-ai/workmate
workmate doctor
workmate init
workmate start
```

Useful local validation commands:

```bash
pnpm agentscope:smoke
pnpm dsh:regression
pnpm concurrency:regression
```

Default local API port: `4328`.  
Default data directory: `~/.workmate`.

## Runtime shapes

Workmate currently supports four practical runtime shapes:

| Runtime | Entry | Support level | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Desktop | `pnpm dev` / packaged app | Full | Reference experience: Electron IPC, `safeStorage`, native file actions, desktop-managed gateway |
| Web launcher | `pnpm web:build && pnpm web:start` | Supported | Built renderer hosted by the local Fastify API; no Electron-only features |
| npm / CLI | `workmate start` | Supported | Same runtime shape as the web launcher |
| Docker | `deploy/docker/workmate/` | Build-supported | Images exist and are documented; parity is still evolving |

The detailed parity matrix lives in [docs/runtime-modes.md](docs/runtime-modes.md).

## Architecture reality

These points matter most if you are evaluating the current implementation:

- Orchestration is server-owned: `/api/orch/**` and SSE are the canonical session/run/project surface.
- The desktop main process is intentionally thin and does not call models directly.
- Secrets for model/search/channel settings remain in the desktop keyring bridge (`safeStorage`) and are never written into `domain.json`.
- `pi` is the default execution engine; `AgentScope` and `dsh` are optional execution backends under the same product surface.
- The local embedding sidecar is still an incremental feature: architecture, provider contracts, state management, and desktop controls exist; true local inference backends are still being productized.

## Release

Pushing a SemVer tag such as `v0.1.0` triggers the desktop release workflow.

Current CI-packaged installers:

| Platform | Architecture | Installer |
| --- | --- | --- |
| macOS | Apple Silicon (arm64) | `.dmg` |
| Windows | x64 | NSIS `.exe` |

Intel macOS and Linux packaging remain disabled in CI for now; see comments in `.github/workflows/release.yml`.
